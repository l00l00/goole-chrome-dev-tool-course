### Revised Book Plan Focusing on APIs and Programmatic Remote Debugging  

---

**Objective**: Create a book tailored to mastering Chrome DevTools APIs and remote debugging, enabling programmatic interactions and integrations for advanced debugging and automation.  

---

### **Part 1: Foundations of Chrome DevTools and APIs**  
**Chapter 1**: Introduction to Chrome DevTools

   - Accessing DevTools through the browser.  

**Chapter 2**: Understanding Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)  
   - Introduction to the Chrome DevTools Protocol.  
   - Key concepts: domains, methods, events.  
   - Tools and libraries that leverage CDP (e.g., Puppeteer, Playwright).  

**Chapter 3**: Setting Up for Programmatic Interaction  
   - Installing required tools (Node.js, Puppeteer/Playwright).  
   - Configuring a development environment.  
   - Connecting to a local or remote browser instance.  

---

### **Part 2: Programmatic Control Using Chrome DevTools Protocol**  
**Chapter 4**: Automating Browser Interaction  
   - Programmatically inspecting and manipulating the DOM.  
   - Capturing and modifying network requests.  
   - Running JavaScript in the browser context.  

**Chapter 5**: Debugging with CDP APIs  
   - Setting breakpoints via the Debugger domain.  
   - Monitoring logs and errors programmatically.  
   - Analyzing performance and memory usage through scripts.  

**Chapter 6**: Working with the Network Domain  
   - Intercepting and modifying requests and responses.  
   - Simulating network conditions (latency, offline).  
   - Monitoring WebSocket and HTTP/2 traffic programmatically.  

---

### **Part 3: Remote Debugging**  
**Chapter 7**: Basics of Remote Debugging  
   - Enabling remote debugging in Chrome (`--remote-debugging-port`).  
   - Connecting to a remote device (e.g., mobile phone, headless server).  
   - Debugging over WebSockets.  

**Chapter 8**: Advanced Remote Debugging Techniques  
   - Attaching multiple clients to a single debugging session.  
   - Synchronizing remote and local debugging workflows.  
   - Managing browser state and session persistence remotely.  

**Chapter 9**: Automating Testing and Debugging Workflows  
   - Integrating CDP into CI/CD pipelines.  
   - Automating regression tests with Puppeteer/Playwright.  
   - Debugging flaky tests through headless scripts.  

---

### **Part 4: Advanced Topics and Use Cases**  
**Chapter 10**: Customizing Chrome for Automation  
   - Using Chrome headless and custom builds.  
   - Modifying browser startup parameters.  
   - Developing and deploying custom DevTools extensions.  

**Chapter 11**: Real-World Use Cases  
   - Case Study 1: Automated performance profiling for a PWA.  
   - Case Study 2: Real-time monitoring of API calls during user interactions.  
   - Case Study 3: Debugging large-scale JavaScript applications in production.  

**Chapter 12**: Contributing to Chromium’s Debugging Tools  
   - Understanding Chromium's debugging modules.  
   - Writing enhancements for CDP or DevTools.  
   - Navigating the Chromium developer community.

### **Expected Outcomes**  
By completing this book, readers will:  
1. Understand and use the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) for programmatic debugging.  
2. Set up and master remote debugging workflows.  
3. Build automation scripts for testing, profiling, and network analysis.  
4. Contribute to or extend Chrome’s debugging tools.
